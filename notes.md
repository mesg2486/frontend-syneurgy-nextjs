# Task at Hand

1. We found out that Universe component uses universe.store.
2. We added logs to the universe.store in vue version.
3. Vue version initially failed as the base API url was not set. We hardcoded the api endpoints.
4. We copied the store variables and we're testing the UniverseChart component.
5. Universe chart component is not displaying any data as of now. But there are no errors so some hope is alive.
6. Find a way to make it work including the animations.
